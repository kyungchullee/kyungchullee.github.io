I am interested in all aspects of computational imaging, including (1) designing advanced computational algorithms, (2) optimizing programmable optical hardware, and (3) applying these innovations to real-world scenarios to maximize imaging throughput. More specifically, my work during Ph.D. has primarily focused on computational phase retrieval for designing and imaging phase profiles. I have invented a novel design and single-shot fabrication method of phase masks for mask-based lensless imaging and built various types of multiplexed imaging systems based on lensless imaging. Additionally, I have contributed to the development of high-speed phase imaging techniques based on Fourier ptychography, significantly reducing the large dataset requirements of conventional reconstruction methods. Detailed information about my experiences is summarized in the following sections.

However, the high costs and limited scalability with conventional fabrication methods are not ideal for mass production of designed lensless cameras. We propose a method for high-throughput fabrication of lensless cameras designed with arbitrary PSFs for various imaging tasks. The workflow of our method includes designing the smooth phase mask profiles for a given PSF pattern and then fabricating the mask in a single shot via the gray-scale lithography technique. We have shown that our method can be used for a flexible production of custom lensless cameras with various pre-designed PSFs and effectively obtain images of the scene via computational image reconstruction. We demonstrate the potential applications of our custom lensless cameras, including the deployment of the learned reconstruction networks for fast imaging and fingerprint detection via optical template matching. The experimental results shown in our work demonstrate a solid potential for manufacturing and deploying compact lensless cameras for diverse real-world imaging applications. </p> <h4>Relevant publications</h4> <ul> <li>Kyung Chul Lee, Junghyun Bae, Nakkyu Baek, Jaewoo Jung, Wook Park, and Seung Ah Lee.

We have built various type of customized lensless cameras to obtain multiplexed information from the single shot lensless measurments. </p> <h4>High Speed Eyetracker with Lensless Imaging</h4> <p> We have developed a goggle-type eye tracker featuring a low-cost, high-speed lensless camera designed to monitor eye movements in individuals with neurodegenerative diseases. By combining a rolling shutter image sensor with lensless computational imaging, the system reconstructs a sequence of time-resolved images from a single snapshot, significantly enhancing the camera's frame rate from 15 Hz to 480 Hz. </p> <h4>Snapshot Hyperspectral Imaging with Lensless Camera</h4> <p> Our device combines a linear variable filter and a phase mask to encode spectral information onto a monochromatic image sensor, enabling the recovery of hyperspectral image stacks from a single measurement. This is achieved by leveraging the spectral information encoded in different regions of the 2D point spread function. Using our prototype, we demonstrate the acquisition of hyperspectral images spanning wavelengths from 410 to 800 nm through single-shot lensless measurements. </p> <h4>Privacy Preserving Imaging via Shift-Variant Lensless Camera</h4> <p> Cameras serve as essential tools for collecting information from the surrounding environment and providing feedback to users, yet they pose a risk to privacy. Here, we propose a method to encrypt the scene at the hardware level by designing the forward model of a lensless camera with engineered shift-variant transfer function and to decode the encrypted scene with a physics-based neural network. </p> <h4>Relevant publications</h4> <ul> <li>Taeyoung Kim, Kyung Chul Lee, Kyungwon Lee, Nakkyu Baek, Jaewoo Jung, Eosu Kim, Bobae Park, Junghee Ha, Keun You Kim, Young-Seok Seo, and Seung Ah Lee.

However, the image reconstruction in FP is inherently ill-posed, particularly when the measurements are noisy and have insufficient data redundancy in the Fourier space. To improve FP reconstruction in high-throughput imaging scenarios, we propose a regularized FP reconstruction algorithm utilizing anisotropic total variation (TV) and Tikhonov regularizations for the object and pupil functions, respectively. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method on the real experimental FP microscopy images, where the TV regularizer effectively suppresses the measurement noise while maintaining the edge information in the biological specimen and helps retrieve the correct amplitude and phase images even under insufficient sampling. </p> <h4>Relevant publications</h4> <ul> <li>Kyung Chul Lee, Hyesuk Chae, Shiqi Xu, Kyungwon Lee, Roarke Horstmeyer, Seung Ah Lee, and Byung-Woo Hong.

Smartphones and mobile devices can be useful for the construction of compact and portable imaging devices, by replacing expensive and bulky optical instruments with state-of-the-art cameras, high-performance processors, and network connectivity in a compact footprint. We propose a smartphone-mountable computational microscope that achieves wide-field and high-resolution imaging, based on the Fourier ptychographic (FP) microscopy technique. Our device uses the smartphone’s built-in camera for microscopy imaging, the display screen for programmable illumination, and the computational power of the smartphone processors for FP image reconstruction. Our device achieves a half-pitch resolution of 870 nm over a wide field-of-view of 2.1 × 1.6 mm² with amplitude, phase, and color imaging capabilities. As global health issues continue to persist and new epidemic challenges arise, we believe that our smartphone microscopy technology can effectively address the clinical needs in point-of-care environments. </p> <h4>Relevant publications</h4> <ul> <li>Kyung Chul Lee, Kyungwon Lee, Jaewoo Jung, Se Hee Lee, Donghyun Kim, and Seung Ah Lee.

We aim to implement semi-supervised learning for virtual staining to enable high-fidelity results while reducing the need for labor-intensive dataset generation. To achieve this, we designed a neural network architecture that digitally stains label-free images of unstained tissue by minimizing style feature differences between the outputs of stained and unstained raw images. Our approach is particularly valuable for computational microscopy techniques that enable various label-free imaging applications, where generating paired datasets is challenging, such as in 3D pathology and immunohistochemistry staining. </p> <h4>Relevant publications</h4> <ul> <li>Kyung Chul Lee, Hyesuk Che, Roarke Horstmeyer, and Seung Ah Lee.
