description: "I have been truly blessed with several opportunities to have my work acknowledged during my time as a PhD student. Yet, nothing compares to the deeply humbling honor of representing the College of Engineering to accept the doctoral degree from the President. Having spent my entire academic journey at this university, to receive such an honor from my academic home fills me with immense gratitude."
